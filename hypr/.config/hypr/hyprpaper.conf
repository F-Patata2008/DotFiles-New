# ===================================================================
# HYPRPAPER CONFIGURATION
#
# This file sets the initial wallpaper and enables IPC (Inter-Process
# Communication) so that scripts can change the wallpaper later.
# ===================================================================

# Set a preload wallpaper. This is the image that will be loaded
# into memory when hyprpaper starts.
# I'm using the path from your example.
preload = /home/F-Patata/Dotfiles/Wallpapers//Gundam/10.jpg

# Set the wallpaper for all monitors. The leading comma means it
# applies to any monitor that doesn't have a specific rule.
# This will be your wallpaper at login.
wallpaper = , /home/F-Patata/Dotfiles/Wallpapers/Gundam/10.jpg

# THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE
# It allows hyprpaper to be controlled by the command line (hyprctl).
ipc = on
